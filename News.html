            <h2 style="bold">Knicks to have resigned Sasha Vujacic</h2>
        
            <p>With a one-year deal for the veteran’s minimum, this move is all about creating depth and providing continuity in the locker room.

Vujacic, 32, played in 61 games for the Knicks in 2015-16. During that time, he played an average of 14.9 minutes per game, accumulating marks of 4.9 points, 2.4 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 0.9 3-point field goals made per contest.

Though he may not be a featured player in 2016-17, his defensive tenacity and 3-point shooting could be of aid. <br><br>Ogden, Maxwell "Knicks Rumors: New York Re-Signs Sasha Vujacic" Dailyknicks.com, July 12, 2016. Web. July 12, 2016</p>
        
            <h2 style="bold">Knicks Look adds More European Power</h2>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, the Knicks reached deals with two European players, Guillermo Hernangomez and Mindaugas Kuzminskas, to fill out their bench. Both players competed in the same top-tier Spanish league as Kristaps Porzingis, a rookie sensation last season after the Knicks drafted him with the fourth pick in the 2015 N.B.A. draft.<br><br>Schonbrun, Zack "Knicks Drawing on Top Spanish League to Stock Bench"NyTimes.com/Sports, July 7,2016.

            <h2 style="bold">Knicks sign Courtney Lee for a 4 year contract</h2>
        
            <p>Free agency is winding down for the New York Knicks, and while they were never in the running for Kevin Durant‘s services, Phil Jackson was still able to put together a group of bonafide players who should complement each other nicely.

One of the players they picked up is eight-year veteran shooting guard Courtney Lee, who agreed to a four-year deal at a reported $48 million. Phil Jackson spoke about some of the team’s needs before Lee was signed, per Marc Berman of the New York Post. <br><br>Silverbush, Rob "New York Knicks: Courtney Lee Fits Like A Glove" Dailyknicks.com, July 6, 2016.

            <h2 style="bold">Knicks resign Lance Thomas</h2>
        
            <p>Thomas has spent the last two years with New York as added depth at the forward positions, and that's exactly what he'll continue to provide as he plays behind Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis. Over 22.3 minutes per game last season, the 28-year-old averaged 8.2 points, 2.2 rebounds, and 0.9 assists, although his season was cut short after a late-season knee injury.<br><br>Staff, RotoWire "Knicks' Lance Thomas: Will sign with Knicks" CBSSports.com/fantasy/basketball, July 5, 2016.
